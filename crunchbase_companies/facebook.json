 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFacebook is the world\u0026#8217;s largest social network, with over \u003Ca href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/One-Billion-People-on-Facebook-1c9.aspx\" title=\"1 billion monthly active users\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003E1 billion monthly active users\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacebook was founded by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"Mark Zuckerberg\"\u003EMark Zuckerberg\u003C/a\u003E in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz\" title=\"Dustin Moskovitz\"\u003EDustin Moskovitz\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"/person/chris-hughes\" title=\"Chris Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EChris Hughes\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"/person/eduardo-saverin\" title=\"Eduardo Saverin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EEduardo Saverin\u003C/a\u003E to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg\u0026#8217;s high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to \u003Ca href=\"/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto\" title=\"Palo Alto\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EPalo Alto\u003C/a\u003E for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of \u003Ca href=\"/company/napster\" title=\"Napster\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ENapster\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"/person/sean-parker\" title=\"Sean Parker\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESean Parker\u003C/a\u003E. Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg\u0026#8217;s apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, \u003Ca href=\"/person/peter-thiel\" title=\"Peter Thiel\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EPeter Thiel\u003C/a\u003E, cofounder of \u003Ca href=\"/company/paypal\" title=\"PayPal\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EPayPal\u003C/a\u003E and managing partner of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund\" title=\"The Founders Fund\"\u003EThe Founders Fund\u003C/a\u003E. Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith millions more users, \u003Ca href=\"/company/friendster\" title=\"Friendster\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFriendster\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/\" title=\"attempted\"\u003Eattempted\u003C/a\u003E to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners\" title=\"Accel Partners\"\u003EAccel Partners\u003C/a\u003E, at a valuation of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/\" title=\"around $100 million\"\u003Earound $100 million\u003C/a\u003E. Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock\" title=\"Greylock Partners\"\u003EGreylock Partners\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners\" title=\"Meritech Capital\"\u003EMeritech Capital\u003C/a\u003E, as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/\" title=\"opened\"\u003Eopened\u003C/a\u003E up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/\" title=\"opened\"\u003Eopened\u003C/a\u003E to anyone with an email address. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the summer of 2006, \u003Ca href=\"/company/yahoo\" title=\"Yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EYahoo\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/\" title=\"attempted to acquire\"\u003Eattempted to acquire\u003C/a\u003E the company for $1 billion dollars. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook\" title=\"Reports\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EReports\u003C/a\u003E actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo\u0026#8217;s stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/\" title=\"offered\"\u003Eoffered\u003C/a\u003E $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \u0026#8220;kid\u0026#8221; who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; \u003Ca href=\"/company/viacom\" title=\"Viacom\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EViacom\u003C/a\u003E had previously \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/\" title=\"unsuccessfully\"\u003Eunsuccessfully\u003C/a\u003E attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot long after, in October 2007, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/\" title=\"Microsoft invested\"\u003EMicrosoft invested\u003C/a\u003E $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/\" title=\"5th most valuable US Internet company\"\u003E5th most valuable US Internet company\u003C/a\u003E, yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft\u0026#8217;s decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/\" title=\"$1.5 billion round\"\u003E$1.5 billion round\u003C/a\u003E, valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/\" title=\"announced\"\u003Eannounced\u003C/a\u003E that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/\" title=\"$42.05\"\u003E$42.05\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne sour note for Facebook has been the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/\" title=\"controversy\"\u003Econtroversy\u003C/a\u003E with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook.

Facebook announced \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/\" title=\"astonishing numbers\"\u003Eastonishing numbers\u003C/a\u003E in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. Over 845 million users log into Facebook every month, and 483 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook\u0026#8217;s user base, with 425 million monthly actives. Facebook also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/\" title=\"most trafficked sites\"\u003Emost trafficked sites\u003C/a\u003E in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacebook users\u0026#8217; \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/\" title=\"passion\"\u003Epassion\u003C/a\u003E\u2014or \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/\" title=\"addiction\"\u003Eaddiction\u003C/a\u003E\u2014to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook.
