 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiscake Stores is one of the Miscake lab research projects. It is a service for building online stores with ease.\nFirst of all, it is designed for people who do not want to spend their time on IT issues and want to be entirely focused on their business matters. Users of Miscake Stores do not have to be familiar with programming languages, hosting and mailing servers administrating and other problems.\nIn order to achieve higher performance Miscake Stores use cutting-edge technology - cloud computing, which is becoming now a trend solution for different businesses. Usually you buy a server (virtual or not) or part of the server resources, but Miscake Stores propose you to buy a service in distributed environment, which means that resources for your business are allocated on demand, i.e. we are a SaaS (software as a service) provider.\u003C/p\u003E",
