 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDYMO is focused on becoming the worldwide leader in providing innovative solutions that help people accomplish their office and home organization tasks more easily and actually look good doing it. DYMO offers a complete range of labeling products for the office, the warehouse, the worksite, the home and even the classroom ranging from simple embossers, manual label makers and desktop products to industrial portables, computer-connected products and supporting desktop software to create and manage custom labels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in California in 1958, DYMO introduced the world\u0026#8217;s first personal label maker, the embosser, revolutionizing the way businesses and individuals organized and identified their offices and surroundings. In the decades after, DYMO expanded its embossers into products for home, office and commercial applications. In the late seventies Esselte, the world\u0026#8217;s leading office supply manufacturer acquires DYMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1990, the brand added electronic label makers with built-in keyboards, LCD screens, numerous formatting functions and high-quality printing. Through a merger with CoStar, who pioneered the US market for small, dedicated label printers that connect to both PC and Macs, DYMO now offers the most complete line of labeling and identification products on the market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005 DYMO is sold by Esselte to Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) and has since trough acquisitions broadened their product lines to include contact management software and business card scanning solutions, mailing and shipping scales and online postage.\u003C/p\u003E",
