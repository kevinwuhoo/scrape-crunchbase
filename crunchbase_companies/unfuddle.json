 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnfuddle is a secure, hosted software development environment and project management solution for small software development teams. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIronically, Unfuddle is nothing new. Project and code management tools have existed for a very long time. However, as a small consulting company, we have often had the opportunity to work with other people\u0026#8217;s code. Despite the wide availability of some excellent tools (many even open source) for helping teams manage their projects, we have been astonished at just how bad some teams are at keeping their projects organized - even at the most basic level. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know that you don\u0026#8217;t have time to get a server up and running and then configure and secure code repositories, ticketing systems and project management tools. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfuddle is our way of helping you and your team do things right.\u003C/p\u003E",
