 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe latest in a trend of toy-based sites, TOOTSVILLE.COM is a virtual world where kids can wander around in the body of a Toot \u0026#8211; an elephant-like creature that\u0026#8217;s sold as a plush toy. Kids who want to go on the site for free can play a variety of games, chat with other Toots, and travel to different worlds (including the moon, a comic world, a dinosaur land, and more). A premium membership, which costs $5.95 a month (or less, if you sign up for six months or a year), gives kids access to extra features, such as the chance to buy clothes and furniture with the \u0026#8220;peanuts\u0026#8221; they collect, play special games, and attend events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETootsville\u0026#8217;s free content should satisfy most kids who are looking for simple problem-solving and arcade games. The \u0026#8220;Tootlympics\u0026#8221; games score big, with virtual gymnastics, volleyball, archery, and more. The cute, colorful world is pretty easy to navigate, although sometimes it\u0026#8217;s a bit tough to control the Toots\u0026#8217; actions. One handy feature is the \u0026#8220;find games\u0026#8221; button, which highlights each area in the world that features a game or activity. Parents will appreciate the site\u0026#8217;s thoughtful approach to safety, but may be annoyed by the merch tie-ins and pushes to upgrade membership. (The site\u0026#8217;s grammatically incorrect copy may also irk eagle-eyed moms and dads.) \u003C/p\u003E",
