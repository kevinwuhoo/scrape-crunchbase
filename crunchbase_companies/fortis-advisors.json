 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFortis is a team of experienced M\u0026amp;A professionals who serve as the post-closing representative of selling shareholders in private company mergers and acquisitions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPost-closing shareholder representation is a complex, time-consuming, burdensome and unpredictable task and involves a commitment that can extend for years.  It requires a dedication of time and effort that most individuals cannot make.  If problems arise, the duties and responsibilities of the shareholder representative increase exponentially, and may even subject the representative to the risk of liability.  Shareholders are increasingly recognizing that it is a task they should not undertake and are looking for an alternative.  Fortis is the solution.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFortis allows shareholders to outsource the burden, responsibility and risk of shareholder representation to professionals with the dedication, experience and expertise to serve that role.  We manage all aspects of the post-closing process, including escrows, holdbacks, working capital and other purchase price adjustments and earn-out/milestone payments.  Our services include shareholder reporting, accounting review of working capital and purchase price adjustments, account and distribution management and the audit of progress toward earn-out and milestone payments.  We handle all communications with the buyer, selling shareholders, escrow agents and other parties who might be involved in post-closing matters and coordinate the actions of each to ensure the process is seamless and efficient.  We tailor our services to each situation to make sure shareholder needs and expectations are fully met. \u003C/p\u003E",
