 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpoolios is a personalized sports news aggregator where users pick the leagues, teams, players or writers they wish to follow in their spool. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a user signs up for Spoolios, they create a list of tags. These could be their teams, rivals, favorite players, leagues, divisions, fantasy sports, or whatever they don\u0026#8217;t want to miss out on. These tags determine which stories show up in their list, which is called a \u0026#8220;spool\u0026#8221;. Once the user sets up their spool, they have a live feed that grabs stories from all over the web that\u0026#8217;s tailored to their interests.\u003C/p\u003E",
