 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJackTheDonkey.com is the community where your time online supports the charity of your choice. Or what some call, a socially conscious social network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJack donates more than half of all ad revenue generated by an individual\u0026#8217;s time online to their choice of more than 20 charities from across Canada and the US, and now the UK to the tune of 1.1 cents every impression (paid at par depending where the charity is registered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6or at least that is the theory\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the advertisers to date have been friends and family so I have been covering the 1.1 cents myself). The number of impressions and how you create them is up to you.  Simply sharing, viewing or commenting on pictures or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep thoughts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d makes cents!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJack also takes a \u0026#8220;softsell\u0026#8221; approach to keeping the charities top of mind among existing supporters, while trickling into the consciousness of potential supporters, as the charities\u0026#8217; Twitter feeds have recently been incorporated into their supporters\u0026#8217; personal profile pages\u0026#8230;viewable to the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the name will always sound a little untraditional, but JackTheDonkey.com is working to connect with individuals who are traditionally unengaged from anything remotely related to volunteerism and fundraising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is another key component to the site that we are rolling out in the near future which will provide an additional stream of funds for the charities on jackthedonkey.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more than  20 charities from across Canada, the US and now the UK that you can choose to support with your time online including: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAlex\u0026#8217;s Lemonade Stand Foundation \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBest Friends Animal Society (featured on Dogtown) \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe ALS Society of Canada \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECanadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECanadian Tire Jumpstart\u00c2\u00ae \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECard Therapy \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChildren\u0026#8217;s Craniofacial Association \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Children\u0026#8217;s Wish Foundation of Canada \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEating Disorders of York Region \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ELilah\u0026#8217;s Fund \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Malibu Foundation for Environmental Education \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENew Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOntario Special Olympics \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPencils For Kids \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPlug In America (featured in Who Killed The Electric Car?) \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERonald McDonald House Charities of Canada \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Reena Foundation \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Scouts Canada Foundation \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESustainable Laos Education Initiatives Inc. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Toronto Wildlife Centre \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Safe Foundation\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAttached is a copy of my first piece of press that I was able to generate locally earlier this summer: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.cjnews.com/images/stories/Heebonics/June_25_09.pdf \nAttached are also links to a couple reviews of Jack that were posted recently on a couple startup related sites: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://startupmeme.com/jackthedonkey-jacks-every-visit-of-yours-to-support-your-favorite-charity/ \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.killerstartups.com/Social-Networking/jackthedonkey-com-support-a-charity-the-social-way \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.JackTheDonkey.com is free for the charities and members of the community, but not for the corporate sponsors/advertisers (who we are actively working to get onboard\u0026#8230;to date they have been friends and family so I have not been charging them while I continue to pay the 1.1 cents per impression to the charities).\u003C/p\u003E",
