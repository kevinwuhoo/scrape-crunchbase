 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Windy Citizen brings Chicagoans the best of the local web by letting them share, rate and discuss their favorite local news, photos, videos and more.  It\u0026#8217;s a crowd-powered front page for the Windy City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers vote up and down the latest submissions and the most popular ones float to the top.  It\u0026#8217;s a mechanism appropriated from popular tech news sites and applied to a brand new problem, local.  Quirky blog commentary, spot photography and round-ups of upcoming events are getting play alongside the most interesting stories from the local press.  Citizen journalists who go local now have a new tool to build their audience.\u003C/p\u003E",
