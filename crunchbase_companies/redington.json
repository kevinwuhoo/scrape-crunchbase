The journey began as a \u0026#8216;Trader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for HP printers for Iran with five people working from a 5,000 square feet premise. The growth from a single product line and a single brand to a multiple brand distributor with unparalleled reach across MEA is the result of foresight, hard work and aggressive expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first four years was a period of growth, calculated risk taking and consolidation. This phase set the pace for Redington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition and vision to grow into a regional leader in the supply of IT and non-IT products. The market was nascent, but the potential was immense and Redington grabbed the opportunity. While the market gathered momentum and maturity, Redington also utilized this phase to study and explore the region for growth possibilities and focused on expanding its product and brand portfolio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2002 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2007: RIDING THE OPPORTUNITY WAVE \nRedington embarked on an exciting phase of growth in tandem with the opening up of the Middle East market. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) markets heralded a more liberal trade and investment environment. The markets were booming and the emergence of more and more tech- savvy people across the region led to a ten-fold growth in Internet usage in the GCC between 1999 and 2003. The tide was in favour of Redington with an unprecedented demand for PCs and peripherals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy this time, Redington had equipped itself with new brand partnerships, an expanded portfolio of products and sound distribution channels to cater to a growth market. Between 2002 and 2007, Redington emerged from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRegional Distributor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As the Partner of Choice for 24 leading global brands in IT and Telecom, Redington had a commanding presence in 19 markets, through 4,829 Channel Partners. As the largest and fastest growing IT distributor in the MEA region, the company had won the honour as the most preferred partner of a growing array of Vendors and Channel Partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2007-2010: THE SUPPLY CHAIN MIGHT \nRedington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on emerging markets and unparallel supply chain prowess has paved the way for the company to become a value-added one-stop-shop for IT distribution and support services across MEA. In 2008, Redington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue surged to over US$1 billion. From five employees, Redington now has a 800 strong work force across MEA. The brand portfolio has swelled to 36 while the channel partners have risen to around 5000 partners across 19 markets. The company now has 18 warehouses with a mother hub warehouse across 94,300 square feet in Jebel Ali, Dubai. Nearly 40 service centres in support services make Redington the largest neutral IT service entity of its kind in the region.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe collective reach of Redington Gulf across markets with efficient and innovative logistics capability now supports its vision to become the leading integrated end-to-end supply chain services provider for its current and prospective global partners.\u003C/p\u003E",
