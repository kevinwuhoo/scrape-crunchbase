 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESaveMe is a content aggregator of collective buying offers which aims to help users find the best deals, to make available various brands in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA super young brand in the market, Save Me was created in July 2010 by two advertising professionals from S\u00c3\u00a2o Paulo, Guilherme Wroclawski and Heitor Chaves. Initially the site received the name ZipMe and had its name changed when it joined the BuscaP\u00c3\u00a9 Group in September 2010. The initial idea was to launch a collective shopping site that offers discounts to users and wholesalers the possibility of making a sale to a large-scale production of various types, but the advertising professionals noted that it would not be a good business to compete in this environment that already had big names. Then they had the idea of putting all existing collective purchasing sites in one place, would be easier for the Internet surfer to find the deals.\u003C/p\u003E",
