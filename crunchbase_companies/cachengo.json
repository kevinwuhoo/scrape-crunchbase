 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECachengo provides data protection/recovery, file sharing, and cloud computing through a single device allowing for a truly simple, affordable solution. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndustries such as legal, financial, and healthcare rely on Cachengo to help conform to regulations and keep their sensitive information safe with features such as unlimited archiving, redundant backup facilities, and unrivaled encryption levels. And with technologies such as bare metal restoration, continuous data protection, and virtual server failover, we are leading the industry in security and functionality. Instead of managing multiple providers with a variety of services, Cachengo customers benefit from an all-in-one solution that ensures unprecedented reliability, affordability, and security.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs information grows in size, complexity, and importance, the ability to adequately protect and share the information also grows significantly. Sadly, such scalable protection comes at a significant cost to the companies hosting such data and to the content providers generating the materials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECachengo\u0026#8217;s goal is to provide the most comprehensive data protection and sharing solutions that can scale without being cost prohibitive to the masses.\u003C/p\u003E",
