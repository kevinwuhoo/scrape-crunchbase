Their first game, released this August, will be FanGamb, short for Fantasy Gambling.  FanGamb is a new online game for sports fans that creates a competition between friends to see who the best sports bettor is.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFanGamb is designed to cure the pain points of traditional fantasy sports thus creating a game that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more fun and keeps players more engaged in the game.  While all sports fans can enjoy the game, the marketing plan is focused on reaching male sports fans, ages 16 to 25.
