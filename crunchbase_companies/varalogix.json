 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re focused on application deployment\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeploying business critical applications has always involved more than just dropping a J2EE app into a middleware server.  Applications don\u2019t exist in a vacuum \u2013 databases, web front ends, networks, external appliances, local support libraries, operating systems \u2013 all need to share configuration information and work as a unit for correct application deployment.  Systems that only deal with one component of this application ecosystem add just another disparate piece to an already complex puzzle. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVaraLogix offers a better approach.  We provide the only solution that has been purposely-built, from the ground up, to automate business critical application deployment and configuration management \u2013 in one solution \u2013 removing risk and uncertainty from the deployment process. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe do it differently.  At a high level, we do it by looking at application deployment from an IT Operations perspective.  This makes us uniquely positioned to bridge the Development / IT Operations gap for agile, secure, scalable operations from development to production.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVaraLogix is led by the same experienced team who founded Build Forge, which was acquired by IBM in 2006. Our team has spent decades addressing deployment automation, configuration, and build and release management issues at Global 2000 companies such as Apple, State Farm, All State, Wells Fargo, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Lockheed Martin and many others.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft, Redhat, Oracle, Electric Cloud and Software House International and have customers within the Financial Services, Retail, Telecommunications, Entertainment, Travel, Insurance, and Education industries who we are helping to:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Increase mission critical application quality and uptime\n\u2022 Accelerate deployment cycles \n\u2022 Deploy to any environment \u2013 physical, virtual, cloud\n\u2022 Lower operational costs\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVaraLogix is privately-held and based in Austin, Texas.  www.varalogix.com\u003C/p\u003E",
