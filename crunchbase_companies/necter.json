 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENecter is taking Facebook head on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENecter\u0026#8217;s goal is to create a social network where privacy and ease of use are the biggest priorities. Current social networks have become boring and consumed with collecting user\u0026#8217;s data.  When MySpace launched in 2003 it gained huge success because of the fun interaction and profile customization people had on the site. Facebook gained success with its minimalist design; Necter is a medium between the two, offering fun interaction and basic profile customization. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there is one social network people use: Facebook. Necter hopes to offer a competitive alternative for users who want something new and different. Necter\u0026#8217;s  competition to Facebook will spur innovation and creativity among social media. Necter is continuing to develop and innovate to create a better service for their users.\u003C/p\u003E",
