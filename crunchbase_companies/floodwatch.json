By comparison, there are about 400 thousand structural fires each year, which result in $6B in damage. Therefore, it is five times more likely that a structure will have significant water damage than fire damage.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, 37% of homeowners have reported water related damage, and fewer than 3% of homeowners have installed any type of water detection and shut-off technology.
