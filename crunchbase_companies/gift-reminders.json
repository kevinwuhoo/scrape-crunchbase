 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGift-Reminders improves conversion rates, increases sales, and helps reduce the competition all while improving your visitors shopping experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGift-Reminders.com provides a cross platform shopping cart plug-in that turns browsers into buyers. This customizable tool enables shoppers to send personalized reminders to themselves about a specific item, on a future date of their choice. When the customer receives their email reminder, they can return to the exact product in just one click. By bringing the customer directly back to the item, the consumer has no need to search the web, and therefore see the competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETesting and tracking guru, David Bullock says, \u0026#8220;The gift reminders service gets the person to \u0026#8216;bookmark without book marking\u0026#8217;. Instead of trying to find what you are looking for, what you are looking for finds you, exactly when you tell it to. A very interesting twist on customer engagement. The numbers suggest a significant \u0026#8216;re-commerce\u0026#8217; effect by using this tool. To at least test it out is a no-brainer. From the numbers we have seen additional revenue of 10% or more is possible with the same traffic you are already getting. This looks to be one way to increase conversion without changing the configuration of your website.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJack Humphrey, of TheFridayTrafficReport.com and one of the most accomplished and experienced on-line marketing experts today says, \u0026#8220;Anyone who is serious about pulling all the sales they possibly can out of their e-commerce site should be interested in tools like this that help them provide a better customer experience while bringing customers back time and again.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
