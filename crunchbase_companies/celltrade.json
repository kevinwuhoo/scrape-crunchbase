 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECelltradeusa.com helps consumers to Get Out of their cell phone contracts without paying hefty early termination fees of $150 - $250 dollars per line. Celltradeusa.com developed a match-making system that expands on something that the carriers already offer their customers - \u0026#8220;contract transfers\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn early 2003, the company developed an online system for Get Out consumers that had no one to take over their plan. They plug them into a nationwide network of Get In consumers who are looking for short-term plans with no activation fee of 35-45 dollars, perhaps a free phone, accessories, or even cash. Celltradeusa matches them up and does the transfer directly with the carrier. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe carrier gets the original contract fulfilled. They also get a happier customer that can have service with them for years.\u003C/p\u003E",
