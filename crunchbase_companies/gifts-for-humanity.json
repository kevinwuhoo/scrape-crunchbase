 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGifts for Humanity provides web services to hep nonprofits capture some of the $250 billion Americans spend each year buying traditional presents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0026#8217;re familiar with Heifer International, then you already know that a well-designed program can attract money normally spent on traditional presents. Heifer does that by making donations, given in a friend\u0026#8217;s name, feel like a gift to both the donor and their friend.   In fact, it\u0026#8217;s so effective, that last year Heifer raised $115 million.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe secret is in providing an appealing gift-like experience.  That requires an online catalog of tangible gifts, printed greeting cards, wish lists, registries and social media tools.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you can imagine, all of these features are too expensive and too daunting for most nonprofits to create themselves.  The good news is, you don\u0026#8217;t have to. GiftsForHumanity.org\u0026#8217;s easy and affordable web service provides everything your organization needs to capture money normally spent on traditional presents.\u003C/p\u003E",
