 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBiocroi based in Dublin, design and develop unique micro/nano multi-well assay plates for use in pharmaceutical drug discovery laboratories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Microplates is a brand of Biocroi and the designs lead to better control of the microplate environment. This in turn improves quality, accuracy and better uniformity of results and results in less assay repeats. This means a reduction in the cost of studies.\u003C/p\u003E",
