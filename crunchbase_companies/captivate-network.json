 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECaptivate Network is the digital-out-of-home advertising network unit of Gannett Company (NYSE: GCI). It delivers digital news and advertising to nearly 3 million consumers on high-resolution, flat-panel TV screens mounted in elevators and lobbies of large urban office buildings and suburban office campuses. Captivate has approximately 8,900 screens in nearly 1,000 buildings in 15 of the top 20 major metro areas or Designated Market Area (DMAs) of North America, delivering 59 million advertising impressions per month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Chelmsford, MA-based company serves corporate, advertising, and real estate customers. It streams news and entertainment content from over 100 major media outlets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as The Associated Press, USA Today, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, WebMD, Wired and Yahoo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as its own original content, simultaneously with advertising in a split screen format. Because of its focus on major metropolitan office towers, advertisers use the Captivate network in an attempt to reach business professionals at their workplace. Similarly, office building owners and managers install Captivate screens to offer their tenants and visitors a premium building amenity.\nUnlike most digital news and advertising networks, which rely on RSS feeds from external news sources, Captivate employs a team of professional editors who customize its news and entertainment content in real time for a local audience and the short format of its digital screens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECaptivate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Canadian network is operated out of Toronto.\u003C/p\u003E",
