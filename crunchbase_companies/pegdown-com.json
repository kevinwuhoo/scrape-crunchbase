 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPegDown.com is a successful demonstration of how PriceDrop intends to solve the \u0026#8216;retail problem\u0026#8217; of the world\u0026#8217;s largest brands. Using PriceDrop, large brands, both manufacturers and retailers, will capture consumer demand that currently remains unrealized in a traditional retail business model. The corporate sellers receive the same revenue per product as they would through current retail sales channels, but at much higher product quantities and their buyers pay much less than retail. \u003C/p\u003E",
