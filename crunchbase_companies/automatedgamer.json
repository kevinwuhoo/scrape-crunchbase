 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAutomatedGamer monitors your personal game list against video game news from across the internet. \nAG\u0026#8217;s game classification technology scans game news sites across the internet, automatically sorting the news by video game, and analyzing what type of news it is. They detect new game trailers, screenshots, reviews and other information; then deliver the latest updates to members monitoring those games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the system calculates an \u0026#8220;AG Score\u0026#8221; for released games. A new review from a source has been detected, AutomatedGamer runs that review score through our proprietary averaging algorithm, and present subscribers with a reliable indicator of how great each game is.\u003C/p\u003E",
