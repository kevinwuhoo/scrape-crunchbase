 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreating and Connecting\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur imagination knows no bounds and we believe in everyone\u0026#8217;s creative abilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Japanese, we describe ourselves as an \u0026#8220;omoshiro\u0026#8221; company. It is hard to translate but it kind of means playful, fun and interesting. What we really want is to create things that are fun for people to use. And that\u0026#8217;s why we hire free-spirited and light-hearted people who won\u0026#8217;t lose their playful creativity at work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKAYAC is what an IT and web company looks like when it is given the freedom to play. Our name is based on the initials of our three directors: KAihata, YAnagisawa, and C(k)uba. And it fits us because a kayak is a nimble and fun little boat that needs a strong, hardworking crew to navigate it, just like our company.\u003C/p\u003E",
