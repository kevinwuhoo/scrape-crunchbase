 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECartouchan has been established to exploit the exponential trend in social media by providing a platform whereby businesses can proactively monitor and respond to the opportunities or threats to their reputation, brand and products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform will provide businesses with the deep analytics to make informed marketing and business decisions to exploit their competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rapid rise in the use and impact of social media by consumers, businesses and government has resulted in an extraordinary generation of content across many forms of new media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs such, there is no regulation on the type of content being produced, in what form it\u0026#8217;s being produced and who generates it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a consequence, businesses have very little control on what content is being disseminated about their organisation and its brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, businesses undertake marketing campaigns and brand awareness activities to build customer loyalty. Through the use of customer surveys, they seek to generate feedback on the success of these strategies.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this existing approach is that this doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect the way consumers are engaging. They are engaging with their colleagues, associates and friends more frequently and honestly through social media channels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is also a reactionary method in so much that business is acting on feedback from consumers after they have executed their marketing campaigns and strategies.\u003C/p\u003E",
