 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESteely Eye is a creative digital agency specialising in new technology. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteely Eye Digital Media was formed in late 2009 by a team of skilled technology executives to deliver innovative, high quality and cost effective mobile systems software, applications, and mobile Internet solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founding team is drawn from veterans of both the mobile software and digital media industries. They are an international team of British and American executives with decades of experience, especially in mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team is headquartered in London, England, at the heart of the mobile and digital media markets in Soho. Management, sales, project control, architecture, graphic design and user experience skills are based in London: most coding is executed by a dedicated nearshore team in Europe. This allows high quality bespoke software to be designed and built at affordable prices, without loss of project oversight, cost control or cultural nuance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteely Eye offers a better, more joined up experience for  customers than the many agencies in this space who create a beautiful design and a radical concept that turns out to be impossible to implement with the technological, time or budgetary constraints in place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy having both a design team and a development team in one organisation, Steely Eye can ensure that they don\u0026#8217;t propose something that cannot be built to look or operate the way it was designed.\u003C/p\u003E",
