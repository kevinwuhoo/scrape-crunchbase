 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of T1D Exchange is to bring together the best of traditional clinical and biological research with the expanding fields of health information technology and virtual community-building.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy delivering a platform to our partners that facilitates an unprecedented knowledge exchange between the research community, Type 1 diabetics, and their caregivers, the T1D Exchange links the entire Type 1 Diabetes community in its efforts to accelerate research and improve healthcare for all Type 1s. The idea is to replicate this model to other disease states globally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe T1D Exchange began as a three-year project funded by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust in 2010. The T1D Exchange platform is comprised of three core components: Glu, clinical registry, and Biobank.\u003C/p\u003E",
