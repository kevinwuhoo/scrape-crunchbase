 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlackRidge is building proactive security solutions to protect against today\u0026#8217;s dynamic security threats. BlackRidge operates secure webs of trust based on insecure network infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current state-of-the art for securing network-connected devices includes the use of firewalls, VPNs and encryption.  While each of these technologies accomplishes a specific mission within the security regime, the demarcation point at each layer exposes information about the services and application provided.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe TCP protocol leaks information.  The specific information being leaked, even in the presence of firewalls, is the presence and identity of, and many times the details about network-attached servers and applications.  This information is exposed because each network-connected device must establish a TCP connection before performing any client authentication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is this property of TCP that enables vulnerability scanning tools to identify which applications are present and in many cases, develop signatures of the network connected device, including the operating system, release and patch levels, application vendors and version and patch levels.  This information may then be used to develop strategies to attack the network-connected device.  Authenticating before establishing a TCP connection closes this security hole and denies attackers the information required to exploit weaknesses in security environments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe BlackRidge technology authenticates on the first packet of a TCP session.  First packet authentication protects data and applications by blocking network services and applications from port scans, network reconnaissance and intrusion, while allowing authenticated users to use network services normally.  \u003C/p\u003E",
