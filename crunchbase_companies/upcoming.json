Here are a few highlights:\r\n\r\n# We've got new a home page, and more info then ever on our search and event pages! We hope it makes exploring the site easier and tasks like planning and inviting friends a snap. Don't just talk about how great it would be to hang out with your friends, go have some fun.\r\n\r\n# What's Nearby helps you find parking, a place to eat and even get cash near an event. Cash always come in handy, and the big map will help you get to know the area before you get there.\r\n\r\n# Finally, the robot has been busy finding lots more events! Big concerts, free events and little puppet shows are yours for the taking. We want everyone to find something they'll like, but if you don't make sure and let us know, it's easy to add your own. Sharing is caring, so make sure to get the word out about your Events. This site is powered by you.\r\nWe hope you like what you see and keep the feedback coming. Go find something to do so you can get out and enjoy your Summer!\r\n\r\n-Vince \u0026 The Upcoming Team",
