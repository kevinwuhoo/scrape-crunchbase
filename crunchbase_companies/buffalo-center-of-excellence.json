 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of the NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics \u0026amp; Life Sciences is to study the mechanistic processes involved in human disease with the goal of developing diagnostics tools and therapeutic interventions, preventative treatment and other disease management devices and processes to improve the health and well-being of the population. This scientific mission is balanced by our responsibility to act as a facilitator of economic development in Upstate New York via partnerships with government, academia and industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Buffalo COE includes one of fifteen NYSTAR Centers for Advanced Technology. The University at Buffalo (UB) CAT focuses on biomedical and bioengineering translational research for development of useful products with commercial potential. By accelerating science transfer, the UB CAT will help foster the creation of new biotech start-up companies and help existing biomedical businesses expand through new or improved product lines.\u003C/p\u003E",
