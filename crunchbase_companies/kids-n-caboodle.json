Personalized baby gifts let people know that they are thought of personally.  The baby shoes and baby gifts that are sold are handcrafted in the US and Canada by craft artisans using the finest leathers and materials.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is owned by Sandy (custombabyshoegirl) Rich, who has over 22 years of entrepreneurial retail/customer care experience in the children\u0026#8217;s retail industry and in elementary and nursery school teaching.  Kids N Caboodle meets an on going need by consumers to be creative and choose baby gifts that are customized rather than mass produced.\u003C/p\u003E",
