 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEcoballot provides web-based voting solutions for paperless school elections.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of Ecoballot is to help schools reduce their environmental impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many schools, the easiest way to start is to reduce paper usage. Ecoballot has analyzed the wasted paper of different schools and found that a significant source of paper waste is election ballots. Voting on paper wastes time, effort, energy, and paper; and yet many schools continue to vote with paper ballots because they have no other choice.  Ecoballot provides an affordable paperless solution to schools who want to vote electronically.\u003C/p\u003E",
