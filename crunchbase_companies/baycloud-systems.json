 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBaycloud Systems develops scalable cloud based systems that address the problem of disempowerment experienced by individuals in the face of technological change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have developed the following products,\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECookieQ is a web application that delivers a Cookie Consent button to any web page. This lets visitors opt in to or opt out of cookies from your web site. It remembers your visitor\u0026#8217;s cookie consent status between visits and removes cookies from their browser unless they have opted in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrackergate.com is a free downloadable application that lets you see which 1st party and 3rd party cookies are being sent from your computer. It can stop tracker cookies from being transmitted to websites that ignore Do-Not-Track requests. It gives advertisers the ability to get specific agreement from consumers before they can track their online behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFamilyControls.com is a downloadable application whereby parents can identify different computer user accounts as those used by children or adults in a family. They can specify the level of content filtering they feel is suitable, and this is enforced using a cloud hosted 2 million URL database of categorized websites. The level of filtering and the age of children is encoded, encrypted and used to label all outgoing content requests, so that router manufacturers can amend any default content filtering that they may offer to families so that it only applies to children and is easily changed by parents. The age of children can be anonymously indicated to social networking websites so that they can make appropriate decisions on what services to offer to children.\u003C/p\u003E",
