 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIdentified at 2008\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Popkomm conference, as one of the most innovative new music companies, RAWRIP.com is a music centric social network making history as the first to give artists and labels 100% royalties earned from every downloaded song.  Using RAWRIP.com, artists can also sell their songs through portable stores (widgets) that allow them to earn 100% from sales on websites including MySpace, Facebook, personal websites, and blogs.  In addition to pay as you go downloads, fans can stream full length music for free, create, manage and share concert calendars, photos, reviews, playlists, and explore new music through a proprietary search engine called \u0026#8216;The Rippler.\u0026#8217; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA patent pending smart search engine using recommendation technology, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Rippler\u0026#8217; was developed by RAWRIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister company Rockbury Media International. The exploration engine automatically analyzes each track by a number of characteristics that are indexed and cross-referenced with RAWRIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catalogue of songs. Through this, songs are revealed to fans based on similarities in sound, allowing fans to discover new music and artists to connect to new fans. Artists can now finally get instantaneously recommended from more popular acts based on how they sound and acquire new fans, without needing an existing fan-base or statistics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERAWRIP.com has taken the successful elements of other services and mixed in fresh new ones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ensuring that this combination of propositions makes RAWRIP.com a truly unique and needed solution in the market. Based on a multiple-streams revenue model, including advertisement, merchandise, tickets, and value added subscriptions, RAWRIP beta was successfully launched in July 2008 and is currently focused on launching its mobile solutions and the new service including a unique label back-end allowing all labels to control, manage and analyze their artists, statistics and demographic information. In addition, RAWRIP.com portals are currently in production for the fast growing markets of China, Russia and India.\u003C/p\u003E",
